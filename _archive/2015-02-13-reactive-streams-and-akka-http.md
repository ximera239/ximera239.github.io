I just returned from an excellent meetup, [Reactive Streams & Akka HTTP by Mathias Doenitz](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/events/219753897/), in Berlin.

It was an interesting talk by Mathias [@sirthias](https://twitter.com/sirthias), the author of [spray](http://spray.io/).
The presentation is currently available only [for Vienna](http://spray.io/vienna/), but hopefully the [Berlin](http://spray.io/berlin/) 
version will also be available soon. In any case, they are the same except for the first presentation page (specifically - the date and city).
